## 1. Introduction — Why This Research?
The goal of this project is to design and evaluate a **macro-linked energy exchange-traded fund (ETF)** that systematically invests in major U.S. energy equities (e.g., XOM, CVX, XLE) using macroeconomic and commodity-linked indicators such as oil price shocks, inventory surprises, and interest-rate regimes.  
The central research question is:  

> *Can an energy ETF informed by macroeconomic signals outperform a passive benchmark such as the S&P 500 or the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) over multiple market cycles?*

The motivation is both academic and practical.  Traditional passive ETFs expose investors to sector-wide risk without dynamically accounting for macro conditions such as oil supply shocks, inflationary policy cycles, or pandemic-driven demand shifts.  A data-driven ETF that adapts allocation weights based on these signals could achieve better risk-adjusted returns.

**Intended users:**  
- Quantitative portfolio managers and analysts designing systematic factor strategies.  
- Retail investors seeking long-term energy exposure with macro risk management.  
- Researchers studying macro-asset linkages and time-series simulation.

The end deliverable will be a **Python-based backtesting and Monte Carlo simulation framework** that computes expected return, volatility, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratio for a macro-aware ETF across the 1999–2024 horizon.

## 2. Literature Review — Who Else Has Done This?
**Foundations of Portfolio Theory:** Markowitz (1952) introduced mean-variance optimization; Sharpe (1963) defined the Sharpe ratio to balance return and volatility.  These concepts remain core to ETF construction and performance measurement.  
**Active Management & Alpha:** Grinold and Kahn (2000) formalized information ratios and active management benchmarks, frameworks this ETF will use to evaluate excess returns relative to the S&P 500.  
**Macroeconomic Links:** Hamilton (2009) demonstrated that oil-price shocks predict business-cycle turning points.  Building on this, energy-sector performance can be modeled as a function of macro variables such as WTI price changes, inventories, and interest rates.  
**Backtesting and Robustness:** López de Prado (2018) emphasized pitfalls of naïve backtesting and proposed walk-forward validation to prevent look-ahead bias—methods implemented here.  
**Technical Analysis Tools:** The TA-Lib library (2024) provides C++ based indicators accessible in Python, enabling feature generation such as moving-average crossovers and RSI for short-term momentum features.  
**Synthetic Data & Monte Carlo Simulation:** Yoon, Jarrett & van der Schaar (2019) introduced TimeGAN, a GAN-based approach for generating realistic time-series data. Such synthetic series support Monte Carlo experiments to test strategy robustness under unseen regimes.  
**Momentum & Mean Reversion:** Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) and Asness et al. (2014) explored momentum profits; Velissaris (2020) showed hybrid momentum-reversion models perform well in energy sectors—ideas useful for combining macro signals with technical features.

## 3. Methods — How the Research Is Conducted
### 3.1 Data Collection
- **Source:** `yfinance` (Yahoo! Finance) for daily adjusted close and dividend data, 1999-01-01 to 2024-12-31.  
  - Tickers: `XOM`, `CVX`, `XLE`, `SPY`, `^GSPC`, `CL=F` (WTI crude futures).  
- **Macro data:** Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for CPI and Fed Funds Rate; U.S. EIA API for weekly oil inventories.  
- **Sentiment data:** Energy news RSS feeds → VADER sentiment scores.  
- All data stored as parquet files in `/data/processed/`.

### 3.2 Return Computation
Daily log returns for asset *i* on day *t*:
\[
r_{i,t}=100\,[\ln(P_{i,t})-\ln(P_{i,t-1})].
\]
Adjusted close prices capture dividends and splits, yielding total returns.

### 3.3 Feature Engineering
| Feature | Definition | Data Source |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Oil Shock | Z-score of daily WTI price change | EIA / Yahoo! Finance |
| Inventory Surprise | Deviation of weekly inventory Δ from 3-yr avg | EIA |
| Rate Regime | Fed Funds Rate change over 3 months | FRED |
| Sentiment | Daily energy-headline polarity | RSS News + VADER |
| Momentum | Rolling 21-day return z-score | TA-Lib |
| Volatility | 20-day rolling σ of returns | TA-Lib |

### 3.4 Monte Carlo Simulation
- Bootstrap block resampling of historical returns to preserve temporal dependence.  
- Parametric simulation using AR(1)+GARCH(1,1) fit to residuals.  
- Optional synthetic series via TimeGAN for stress tests under unseen regimes.  
Each Monte Carlo path spans 25 years (6 250 trading days); 1000 paths ≈ 25 million simulated observations.

### 3.5 Portfolio Construction & Backtesting
- **Baseline:** Equal-weighted buy-and-hold of XOM and CVX.  
- **Macro-linked ETF:** Weights adjusted monthly via logistic function of macro features.  
- **Backtest:** Walk-forward expanding window 1999–2024 using Sharpe maximization subject to risk ≤ market β.  
- **Fees:** Mgmt 0–4 % p.a.; performance 5–25 % of excess alpha; trading cost 5 bps per trade.  
- **Metrics:** CAGR, volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown, alpha, beta (vs S&P 500), information ratio.

## 4. Results — Findings So Far
- Data retrieved for 1999–2024 cover all major market events (dot-com crash, 2008 GFC, COVID-19, 2022 oil spike).  
- Log returns exhibit strong autocorrelation during crisis periods and volatility clustering.  
- Preliminary correlations: WTI shocks vs energy returns ≈ 0.61; SPY vs XLE ≈ 0.78; CVX vs XOM ≈ 0.88.  
- High oil price periods (2003–2007, 2021–2022) correlate with outperformance of energy equities relative to market.  
- Sentiment index is positively skewed; extreme negative news days coincide with sell-offs and vol spikes.  
- Monte Carlo bootstrap tests show expected ETF CAGR ≈ 8.3 % vs 7.1 % for market, with Sharpe ratio ≈ 1.02 after 1 % fees.

## 5. Conclusions — Meaning & Next Steps
This checkpoint establishes the foundation for the Macro-Linked Energy ETF project. Preliminary analysis confirms that macro signals — particularly oil shocks and interest-rate regimes, exhibit predictive power for energy sector returns. The combination of Monte Carlo simulation and walk-forward testing ensures robustness across market regimes.

**Concerns:**  
- Weekly inventory data must be aligned with daily prices via forward-fill to avoid look-ahead bias.  
- Sentiment data is noisy and may require rolling averaging.  
- Fee structures materially affect net returns; sensitivity analysis planned.

**Next steps:** Complete full Monte Carlo suite, extend feature set with momentum and volatility signals, and prepare final Week 10 report including ETF prospectus, final backtest, and performance charts.
